### Detect stale temperature sensors
This blueprint checks for stale sensors every x-hours for a specific 'last updated' time of an entity. (to detect an empty battery before the sensor is marked as unavailable) <br />
For many sensors the battery state is not reliable or frequently updated, so a device may be stale without knowing it. This is the case for multiple sensors, like: LYWSD03MMC temperaturesensor or the HHCCJCY01 plantsensor.
